# Team-Project-Wizrad-Unity-Game

Team Project from CS4480.

This is an older version as I no longer have access to school bitbucket account, which stores the final project.
The concept of the game is that you play a rad wizard.

There some missing features, levels, bosses, monsters, etc..

But parts of the game is still playable.

Check the gif for gameplay.
