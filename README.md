# Team-Project-Wizrad-Unity-Game

Team Project from CS4480.

This is an older version as I no longer have access to school bitbucket account, which stores the final project.
The concept of the game is that you play a rad wizard.

There some missing features, levels, bosses, monsters, etc..

But parts of the game is still playable.

The game was completed as part of the CS4480 Capstone Project.

Check the gif for gameplay (old version gameplay, aprox 3 min long).
